## Nonrepudiation
- What is nonrepudiation in the context of digital systems?
- Why is it important for applications like online bookstores?
- What other tools/technologies besides logging can help achieve nonrepudiation?


Nonrepudiation means “cannot deny,” so in digital systems, it refers to the ability to ensure that a user cannot deny an action they performed within the system. This is important because it can serve as evidence when someone tries to cheat or access important information, and it ensures that users’ actions are traceable and their data is secure. In other words, nonrepudiation acts as proof of a user’s action.

In online bookstores, nonrepudiation is crucial because it provides proof when users perform actions such as adding a book, placing an order, or updating their account. The system can record details like timestamps and IP addresses for these actions, serving as evidence that the user indeed performed them and preventing disputes later.

Besides logging, there are other tools and technologies that help achieve nonrepudiation:
- Digital signatures: Verify that the user actually performed the action.
- Audit trails: Record detailed user activities within the system.
- Blockchain: Provides immutable records that cannot be altered after creation.

In conclusion, nonrepudiation helps make digital systems more secure, reliable, and trustworthy.
